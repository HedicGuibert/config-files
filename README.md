Just a collection of settings to ease the installation of new machines.

These are my personal preferences.
The color themes, however, are objectively the best. Using anything else is just pure griefing.

Just run
```
bash install.sh
```

It will overwrite your .gitconfig and .bashrc, and will install some packages as well as VSCode, so use mindfully!
